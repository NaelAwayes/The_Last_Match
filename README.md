# The Last Match

### What is this ?

The Last Match is a game I had to make during my first year of scholarship at Prep'ETNA.
It is greatly inspired by [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) ([Jeu de Marienbad in French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeu_de_Marienbad)), and is a game where two players take turns removing matches from distinct lines.


### How to play ?

Run `thelastmatch.sh` located in the "thelastmatch" folder.

The Usage for the script is : `USAGE : ./thelastmatch.sh [number_of_lines]` where `number_of_lines` is to be replaced with the amount of lines of matches you want to display at the beginning of the game.

Then when prompted, you have to type first the number of the line where you want to remove matches, and then the amount of matches you want to remove from that line.

You're playing against an (kind of stupid, it is random) AI, but a PVP script is available in the "bonus folder", along with other, somehow more elaborated, AIs.
